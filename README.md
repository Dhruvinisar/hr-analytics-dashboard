# HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Power BI

 Project Overview
This HR Analytics Dashboard was designed to help HR teams see the bigger picture behind their workforce data. Using Power BI, I created an interactive report that highlights where and why employees are leaving, which departments are most affected, and how factors like age, education, salary, and job role impact attrition.

Objectives
- Monitor key HR metrics: headcount, attrition, salary, and tenure
- Identify trends in attrition across age, education, salary levels, and job roles
- Enable leadership to make informed HR policy decisions

Key Features
- KPI cards showing Employee Count, Attrition, Avg. Age, Avg. Salary and Years at Company
- Attrition analysis by:
  - Age Group
  - Gender
  - Job Role
  - Education Level
  - Salary Range
  - Years at Company
- Department and role-based filtering

 Business Impact
- Understand which departments or roles are most affected by attrition
- Analyze retention based on demographics and compensation
- Improve hiring and employee engagement strategies
